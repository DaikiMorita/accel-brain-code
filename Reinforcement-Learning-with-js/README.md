# Reinforcement Learning with JavaScript

These JavaScript modules are library to implement `Reinforcement Learning`, especially for `Q-Learning`.

## Description

These modules functionally equivalent to [pyqlearning](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning). Considering many variable parts and functional extensions in the Q-learning paradigm, I implemented these scripts for demonstrations of *commonality/variability analysis* in order to design the models.
