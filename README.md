# accel brain code

This repository is my private case study in the context of my website: [Accel Brain](https://accel-brain.com) (Japanese).

## Description

The basic theme in my website is multiple perspectives methodology, very abstract theory, extreme aesthetics, recognition of melancholic history, and generalized design philosophy of algorithms and architectures. All code was implemented for the purpose of proof-of-concept, demonstration experiment, or verification test.

## [Automatic-Summarization](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Automatic-Summarization)

- These python scripts create a summary with the major points of the original document or web-scraped text.

## [Binaural-Beat-and-Monaural-Beat-wih-python](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Binaural-Beat-and-Monaural-Beat-wih-python)

- This is a Python library for creating the binaural beats or monaural beats. You can play these beats and generate wav files. The frequencys can be optionally selected.

## [Cardbox](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Cardbox)

- This is the simple card box system that make you able to find and save your ideas.

## [Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern)

- These Python Scripts create a restricted boltzmann machine, deep boltzmann machine, and multi-layer neural networks.

## [Reinforcement-Learning](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning)

- These Python Scripts create a template method pattern for implementing a Q-learning.

## [Subliminal perception](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Subliminal-Perception)

- These JavaScript are tool for experimentation of subliminal perception.
