# accel brain code

- This repository is my private case study in the context of my website: [Accel Brain](https://accel-brain.com) (Japanese). The basic theme is multiple perspectives methodology, very abstract theory, extreme aesthetics, recognition of melancholic history, and generalized design philosophy of algorithms and architectures. All code was implemented for the purpose of proof-of-concept, demonstration experiment, or verification test.

## [Automatic-Summarization](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Automatic-Summarization)

- Demonstration on Automatic Summarization, abstraction, or filtering.

## [Binaural-Beat-and-Monaural-Beat-wih-python](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Binaural-Beat-and-Monaural-Beat-wih-python)

- Python library for creating the binaural beats or monaural beats. You can play these beats and generate wav files. The frequencys can be optionally selected.

## [Cardbox](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Cardbox)

- JavaScript demo to use cardbox system.

## [Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Deep-Learning-by-means-of-Design-Pattern)

- Python demo to verify effectiveness of object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design, and GoF's design pattern.

## [Reinforcement-Learning](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Reinforcement-Learning)

- Reinforcement-Learning algorithm demo.

## [Subliminal perception](https://github.com/chimera0/accel-brain-code/tree/master/Subliminal-Perception)

- JavaScript tool for experimentation of subliminal perception.
